\section{Applications}
\subsection{Gaussian elimination}
\begin{definition}[Elementary row operations]
    Consider a matrix \(A \in \Matrices{m}{n}\), we define three elementary row operations on A:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item multiplication of one row by a non-zero scalar c, denoted by \(\func{e_r}{c}\).
    \item replacement of \(r_\cardinalTH\) row of \(A\) by row \(r\) plus \(c\) times row \(s \neq r\) that is \(r_{\text{new}} = r + cs\) and it is denoted by \(\func{e_{rs}}{c}\)
    \item Interchange two rows \(e_{rs}\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    To each elementary row operation \(e\) there corresponds an elementary row operation \(e^{-1}\), of the same type as \(e\), such that \(\func{e^{-1}}{\func{e}{A}} = \func{e}{\func{e^{-1}}{A}} = A\) for any \(A\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    It is easily verified by hand.
\end{proof}
\subsection{LU decomposition}

\begin{theorem}
    There exists a permuation of a matrix \(A\) that is \(LU\) decompositionable.
\end{theorem}
